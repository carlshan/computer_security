# Computer Security - Nueva Spring 2017

This repository contains code for the Computer Security class taught at The Nueva Upper School during Spring 2017.

Co-instructors: Jen Selby and Carl Shan

## Description
Computer Security was taught in Spring 2017 as an elective class at The Nueva Upper School in San Mateo, California.

This repository contains some of the public code I (Carl) wrote during this course for demonstration or educational purposes.

The course focuses on the systems and protocols meant to keep electronic data usable only by those who have been granted access by the owner of the data â€“ and how these systems often fail. We will look at this topic from both ends: how attacks work and how people currently defend against them. In addition, we'll discuss some of the legal and ethical implications of getting involved in this work.
